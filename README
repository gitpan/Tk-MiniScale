Tk::MiniScale

A miniature Tk::Scale used when the user doesn't really care about the
actual value of the variable they are modifying. In other words - they
just want to increase or decrease *something* by a relative amount.
This implies that less precision is needed and therefore less space can
be used to draw this widget. i.e. the increment per pixel can be higher
than in a normal scale

Install like you would any other perl module (where X.X is
the version number you have downloaded):

   gzip -d Tk-MiniScale-X.X.tar.gz
   tar -xvf Tk-MiniScale-X.X.tar
   cd Tk-MiniScale-X.X
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test    #see NOTE below
   make install

For Windows and ActiveState Perl, replace "make" with "nmake". If
you do not have the Visual C++ compiler available or have nmake
installed on your system then just copy the following files to
C:\Perl\lib\site\Tk :

MiniScale.pm
